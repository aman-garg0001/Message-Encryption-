# Message-Encryption-
This repository provides an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt a message using the concepts of graph theorey.

# Dependencies
1. NumPy

# Algorithm
The algorithm used for encryption is based on graph theory and matix multiplication. Here we take help from adjancy matrix and hamiltonian path. First the text is represented in form of hamiltonian graph. Then this graph is assigned false weights and is converted into a completet graph.

# Theory
This code is an implementation of a research paper https://rspublication.com/ijca/OCT12/12.pdf
